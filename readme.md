Hello,

You can use Bonds4all.postman_collection.json file for testing on postman.

I have not written any documentation, I hope it will not be a problem.

As a database embedded h2 used.
For running the application please use 2 commands below.

`1-> ./gradlew clean build`
`2-> java -jar ./build/libs/bonds4all-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`

Thanks.
